            <h2>How the Calculator Works</h2>
            <p>The calculator considers the following factors to provide an estimate of your net take-home pay:</p>
            <ul class="no-bullets">
                <li><strong>Student Loan Repayments:</strong> Deductions based on your selected student loan plan. Plan 1 and Plan 2 have different thresholds and repayment rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Pension Contributions:</strong> Calculated according to your annual salary. The rate of contribution varies depending on your salary band.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax:</strong> Income tax is calculated based on current UK tax bands and personal allowance thresholds.</li>
                <li><strong>National Insurance:</strong> Contributions are calculated on your gross salary above the tax-free allowance, with different rates applied to different salary bands.</li>
            </ul>
