        <h1>Teacher's Back-dated Pay Calculator</h1>

        <p>This calculator helps UK teachers estimate their back-dated pay due to a recent pay rise. It considers the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Student Loan Repayments:</strong> Deductions based on the selected student loan plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Pension Contributions:</strong> Calculated according to your annual salary and relevant pension contribution rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Net Payment:</strong> The final amount is your net back-dated pay after considering taxes, student loan repayments, and pension contributions.</li>
        </ul>

        <form id="payCalculator">
            <label for="currentSalary">Enter your current salary (Â£):</label>
            <input type="number" id="currentSalary" required>

            <label for="studentLoan">Select your student loan plan:</label>
            <select id="studentLoan">
                <option value="none">No Student Loan</option>
